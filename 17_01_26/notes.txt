Primitive vs Non-Primitive

Primitive = Simple stuff
Basic data types. Just hold one single value. Like int, char, boolean, float, double. They store the actual value directly. Simple and fast.

Non-Primitive = Complex stuff
Objects and arrays. Can hold multiple values or nothing (null). Like String, Arrays, your own classes. They don't store the actual data, they store the address where data lives.

Think: Primitive is like writing a phone number on paper. Non-Primitive is like writing directions to a house.


Variables

Just boxes that hold values. You give them a name and they store something for you. Like int age = 25 means you made a box called "age" and put 25 in it.


Stack Memory vs Heap Memory

Stack = Quick notes board
Stores method calls and primitive variables. Fast and organized. When method finishes, everything gets erased automatically. Small space. Works like a stack of plates, last in first out.

Heap = Storage warehouse  
Stores objects and arrays (non-primitive stuff). Bigger space. Things stay here until garbage collector cleans them up. All objects live here, stack just keeps their addresses.
