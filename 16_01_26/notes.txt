Java Installation

Step 1: Download JDK
Go to Oracle website or search "download JDK". Get the latest version for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux). Download the installer file.

Step 2: Install it
Run the installer. Just keep clicking next. It will install Java on your system. Remember where it installed (usually Program Files on Windows).

Step 3: Set Environment Variables
This is important. You need to tell your computer where Java is.

For Windows:
Search "environment variables" in start menu. Click "Environment Variables" button. Under System Variables, click "New". Variable name = JAVA_HOME. Variable value = path where JDK installed (like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17). Find "Path" variable, edit it, add new entry: %JAVA_HOME%\bin

For Mac/Linux:
Open terminal. Edit bash profile (nano ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc). Add these lines:
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
Save and run: source ~/.bash_profile

Step 4: Verify Installation
Open terminal or command prompt. Type: java -version
If you see version info, you're done. If not, recheck environment variables.

That's it. Java is ready to use.
