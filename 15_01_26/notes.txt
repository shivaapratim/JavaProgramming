JAVA BASICS



JDK, JRE, JVM  

Think of it like school:

JDK = Teacher + Syllabus
This is what YOU need to write and build Java programs. Has all the tools to create your code. Like a teacher who gives you everything to learn.

JRE = Classroom
The environment where your program runs. Has all the libraries and stuff needed to execute code. Like a classroom with all the facilities.

JVM = Student Learning
Actually runs your code and makes it work. Takes your bytecode and executes it. Like the student who actually does the learning.


Class vs Object

Class = Blueprint/Design
Just a plan, not the real thing. Example: House design on paper. Defines what properties and behaviors something will have.

Object = Actual Thing
Real instance made from the blueprint. Example: The actual house built from that design. You can make many houses (objects) from one design (class).

Think: Recipe (Class) vs Actual Cake (Object)
Recipe tells you how to make it. Cake is what you actually get when you follow it. You can bake 10 cakes from 1 recipe.
